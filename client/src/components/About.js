                easy<b>Read</b> helps improve its readers' comprehension and
                focus by using the Bionic Reading method, which creates
                artificial fixation points within the coverted text. Initial
                letters of each word are bolded, so the reader is only focused
                on the highlighted letters. The reader's brain is able to center
                complete each word, creating a more shallow form of reading. As
                a result, readers are able to experience a deeper understanding
                of the text.
